Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
To store and organize information

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Traversing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting, Sorting, and Merging.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Compiler Design, Operating System, Database Management System, Statistical analysis package,
Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and Simulation

what is an Array?
A container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array is static in size that is fixed length whereas ArrayList is dynamic in size .

what is LinkedList?
It's a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
In array, elements are stored in consecutive manner in memory whereas in linked list, elements can be stored at
any available place.

what is queue?
It's a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure in which the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

what is stack?
It's a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. In a stack, we remove the item that was most recently added.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is First-In-First-Out and LIFO is Last-In-First-Out

what is the order of complexity?
When you optimize your code for speed and an input requires size of N in the code, it will have O(N) complexity.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
First element of the list.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Last element of the list.

what is tree in data structure?
It simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
Consists of finite set of vertices or nodes together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices
for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable is synchronized whereas HashMap is not.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS - Array
Network data model - Graph
Hierarchical data model - Trees

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap provides put(key, value) for storing and get(key) method for retrieving values from HashMap.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
It's an exception that is thrown when one to access an array item that doesn't exist.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Create the new array, copy the first array and store the values into the new array.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Array size is fixed in size but linked list is dynamic in size.

What is DFS and BFS?
Depth First Search and Breadth First Search

What is Recursion?
When a method calls itself to solve a problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Linear Data Structures - Arrays, and Linked Lists
Non-linear Data Structures - Trees, and Graphs

What is Big-(O)-notation?
It's used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Quicksort - ?(n log(n))
Mergesort - ?(n log(n))
Heapsort - ?(n log(n))
Bubble Sort - ?(n^2)
Insertion Sort - ?(n^2)
Selection Sort - ?(n^2)
Shell Sort - ?(n(log(n))^2)
Bucket Sort - ?(n+k)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
